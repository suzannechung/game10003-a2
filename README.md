# Game 10003 - Assignment 2 - 2D Interactive Drawing

My 2D interactive drawing is called Boo!
When you launch the program, you will see night sky, with moving clouds and fog!
When you press the spacebar, you will illuminate the skies with some stars!
When you press down on the mouse left click, you will see some ghosts pop up into the scene!!

Enjoy the spooky scene :)
